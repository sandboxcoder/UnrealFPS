## About

Sample Unreal FPS project. Currently, this is based on the FPS UnrealProject template.

## Unreal Editor - Exiting the Simulation

Go to Editor Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Find "Play World" and change key of "Stop Simulation" from Esc to something else.
Personally, I bound this to the "END" key on my Windows keyboard. This way when you hit ESC ingame
you'll see the Pause menu.

## Unreal Engine version

Currently using UE 5.5.3. You'll need to have [UnrealEngine](https://github.com/sandboxcoder/UnrealEngine) locally installed in order to compile this project.
